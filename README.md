**OBJECTIVE**

Create a database that permits researchers to analyze the social, economic and environmental conditions that correlate with the World Happiness Index, thereby helping them link critical factors that support quality of life and welfare. 


**IMPACT**

Happiness is an essential and helpful way to guide public policy and measure its effectiveness. Historically (since the first Happiness report in 2005), various forms of macroeconomic data have been widely used. However, as economists and field experts such as neuroscientists, sociologists, statisticians, etc., realize that traditional metrics are insufficient to evaluate, newer (and more complex) data has been included year after year. 

Overall, when a countryâ€™s fabric is strong, feelings of well-being can grow because people work together to solve problems and appreciate their support. This is crucial as public and policy attention starts to shift from a very traditional GDP to broader measures of progress that are more inclusive.
